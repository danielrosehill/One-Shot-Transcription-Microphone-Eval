Brazil now produces roughly one-third of the world's coffee supply, followed by Vietnam and Colombia. Modern coffee culture has evolved significantly from its origins, speciality coffee roasters focus on single-origin beans, careful roasting profiles and precise brewing methods. Terms like pour-over, cold brew and third wave have entered common vocabulary. Meanwhile, instant coffee remains popular in many countries for its convenience. The science behind coffee extraction involves balancing temperature, grind size, water quality and contact time. Too fine a grind leads to over-extraction and bitterness while too coarse results in weak sour flavours. Water temperature between 90 and 96 degrees Celsius is generally considered optimal. Caffeine content varies widely depending on brewing method and bean variety. A typical espresso shot contains less total caffeine than a large drip coffee, despite tasting much stronger. Robusta beans contain nearly twice the caffeine of Arabica but are considered inferior in flavour. Whether enjoyed as a morning ritual or an afternoon pick-me-up, coffee remains one of the most widely consumed beverages on earth, second only to water and tea.",
